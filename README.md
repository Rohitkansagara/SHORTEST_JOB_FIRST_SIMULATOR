# SHORTEST_JOB_FIRST_SIMULATOR

This is a simple web-based simulator for the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. SJF is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest burst time to execute next, minimizing the average waiting time.

Features:
Enter process details, including Process ID, Burst Time, and Arrival Time.
Visualize the Gantt chart to see the execution order.
View statistics such as Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time.
Supports both preemptive and non-preemptive SJF algorithms.


How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Enter process details in the provided form:

Process ID: Unique identifier for the process.
Burst Time: Time required for the process to complete its execution.
Arrival Time: The time at which the process arrives in the queue.
Click the "Enter values" button to add the process to the table.

Continue adding more processes as needed.

Click the "Show Gantt Chart" button to visualize the execution order of processes using a Gantt chart.

View the statistics in the table below the Gantt chart, including the Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time.
